# sudoku_website
its a webiste that displays and runs sudoku. its sudoku. you have a 9x9 grid of numbers and you fill a sqaure in by each number that is not in the same row, colum and 3x3 square.


I learned a lot of new things for this project like using an API in JS but also out of the ones we had to pick was the card flip with css animations which was fun

I belive the code I made here was good quility. and user expience was taken into account. like having the game be clean and easy to use and almost intitive. I also had to account the user willing ness to wait and wait times. That is why you get a diffrent puzzle each time. Cause I cant call a selected diffaculty. This was the biggest problem I ran into. trying to get the API to work how I wanted then realized I cant then shifting my idea into a different mannor

I used AI in the mannor of which I would lay out a frame work and get it almost working then have AI fill in the rest for me. I would have the basic logic code and then have it help me intergrate it into the system. I have a different folder called test where I bounced and tested code untill it fallowed the logic then have AI assisted in 

It was really hard to get AI understand the API requirments so I did alot on that end but it was good at using bootstrap and helping it make it look nice which was nice.
